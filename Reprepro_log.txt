gpgme gave error Pinentry:32870:  Inappropriate ioctl for device
ERROR: Could not finish exporting 'sh23'!
This means that from outside your repository will still look like before (and
should still work if this old state worked), but the changes intended with this
call will not be visible until you call export directly (via reprepro export)
Changes will also get visible when something else changes the same file and
thus creates a new export of that file, but even changes to other parts of the
same distribution will not!
